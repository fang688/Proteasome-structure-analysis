# Proteasome-structure-analysis
Proteasome structure analysis package (Pymol)
The package contains:
  a.	 The Pymol scripts of Cryo-EM structure analysis.
  b.	The PDB files of the 26S structure from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (Dong 2018).
  c.	Folders for separately saved ATPase interfaces and nucleotide-binding pockets coordinate files. Details see step 12.
